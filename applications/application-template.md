### Overview

- Wuji Games - Regenerative Gaming
- WUJI GAMES and Earth Defenders

Wuji Games is a Regenerative Rewards NFT engine for positive earth actions like planting trees. Wuji can integrate positive Environmental Action into all games and transactions utilizing our Regen NFT Engine & Metaverse. A portion of all in-game sales from the NFTs (i.e. Skins, Tools, Characters, Weapons, Land and in-game level ups) will go towards planting trees with EdenProjects.org and then NFTs representing the trees get minted. After each tree gets planted it will be uploaded to as a NFT, creating our Protocol- Proof-of-CHI. The CHI is a protocol where a record is created and stored using an ERC1155 NFT Token and Polygon- Ethereum's Internet of Blockchains,
 
We have gamified this process with our Feature game Earth Defenders a Unity Metaverse with a focus on teaching Permaculture, offgrid techniques, home building and mini games around solving the SDGs. Wuji’s first Game is Earth Defenders will utilize Wuji’s Regenerative Gaming NFT Rewards Engine . Unity Metaverse (Gamesinteractive.co.uk - Siegeworlds.com) *WUJI UTILIZES SAME GAME COD
